   <h2 id="the-kapital-you-shareholders-agreement">The Kapital You Shareholders Agreement</h2>

<p>The Kapital You Shareholders Agreement (KYSA) is a template for setting up a Human Capitalist company that cannot subordinate employees or subcontractors either contractually or economically, but that can still trade with other businesses that are subordinating, as long as those businesses are not controlled in any way by the company or by any of the Human Capitalists that control the company.</p>

<p>The KYSA is a joint venture contract between a company, it’s directors and shareholders, and independent contributors who are entitled to part of the company’s income and can vote on it’s actions. It requires any contributions of human time and effort to the company, or to any entities that the company controls, to be treated as a contribution of capital rather than as employment or as a subcontracting relationship.</p>

<p>Each contributor (including the directors and shareholders) receives a portion of the company’s income, and has an equivalent portion of democratic control over the company. This control is exercised by directly voting on all decisions of the company, and the company’s directors are bound by the KYSA to implement all decisions made by the contributors, and to take no action that has not been authorised by such a decision.</p>

<p>The exact proportion of income (and the equivalent proportion of control) that each contributor has is negotiated with the other contributors, and recorded in a “contribution contract” between that contributor and the company. The contribution contract also sets out what the contributor promises to do for the company in return for their portion of income and control, and the contributor is then free to deliver that contribution in whatever way they choose, as long as it meets the terms of the contract.</p>

<p>Because a contributor may provide things to the company that create residual value and that will continue to generate income for the company beyond the term of the contribution contract, the contribution contract may also entitle the contributor to receive shares in the company at particular times, and those shares will entitle the contributor to receive income and have proportionate control over the company as long as those shares are held. The relative weight of income and control that results from current contribution contracts vs shareholding received during prior contribution contracts will be subject to negotiation between contributors whenever contribution contracts are renewed or created, and thus will reflect the relative value of current and past contributions.</p>

<p>The KYSA contains clauses that enforce the supporting principles of Human Capitalist businesses <a href="/principles.html">that you can read about here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KapitalYou/kysa">The KYSA is currently a work in progress as a project here on GitHub</a> - it is only half-finished, but there is already plenty that might be helpful to you in setting up a Human Capitalist business of your own. It is here on GitHub so that people can collaborate in finishing it, and extending it with any good ideas or corrections they may have. If you would like to get involved, please feel free to submit some GitHub <a href="https://github.com/KapitalYou/kysa/issues">issues</a> or  <a href="https://github.com/KapitalYou/kysa/pulls">pull requests</a> - it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

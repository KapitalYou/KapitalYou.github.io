    <div class="summary">Get rid of the boss, without having to become one yourself. Start a multi-person company where everyone involved is an entrepreneur and nobody has to be an employee.</div>
   

    


    

   <p>Subordination - and therefore employment - can be patronising, infantilizing, and dehumanizing. Anyone who has followed employer instructions that were foolish or detrimental to their own wellbeing understands this in an intuitive and visceral way.</p>

<p>It’s an experience familiar to far too many workers, and a major reason that many people try to start their own business - because while all workers are subordinates, entrepreneurs are generally not. Unfortunately, doing so presents them with a dilemma - either try to make it as a sole trader, working long hours competing with bigger businesses that benefit from teamwork in a way that they can’t, or alternatively to hire employees who are then subject to the very same subordination they themselves are trying to escape - which is an unpleasant prospect for many people.</p>

<p>So how can you escape subordination by starting your own business - with the help of others - in a way that does not involve subordination? The answer is both obvious and simple:</p>

<p><strong>Create a multi-person business that has no employees.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Create a business that is just a group of entrepreneurs, contributing their time and effort to the business on their own terms.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Recognise that when someone does contribute time and effort to the business, they are contributing Human Capital, and recognise this contribution of human capital in the same way the contribution of financial capital is usually recognised - with a proportionate share in the control of the business, as well as a proportionate share of the risks and rewards of the business, without any subordination of the contributor to the business.</strong></p>

<p>That might sound a bit like a worker co-operative, but it’s actually the opposite. Worker co-operatives are explicitly designed to give workers, who are subordinate to the collective, some measure of control over the business they are subordinate to. Workers in co-operatives seek guaranteed stability of wages, employment, and work conditions, and are shielded from both the downside and upside risks of business performance. Workers in co-operatives are just workers who endure subordination, not entrepreneurs who enjoy freedom. Recognising people’s time and effort as contributions of Human Capital is a liberating and rewarding alternative.</p>

<p>A Human Capitalist business is defined by the problem it is trying to solve - subordination, and by the method it uses to solve it - recognising human time and effort as capital contributed by Human Capitalists. This means that any Human Capitalist organisation should follow two core principles:</p>

<p><strong>1. No Subordinates</strong> - The organisation should not subject any person to subordination.</p>

<p><strong>2. All contributions are capital</strong> - Contributions of human time or effort should be recognised as a contribution of capital rather than a purchase of labor, and should be compensated only by a proportionate share of control of the business and of the business profits, on the same terms as all other types of capital.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of indirect subordination to consider, and there are also some supporting principles that would be useful for most Human Capitalist organisations, <a href="/principles.html">which you can read about here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/agreement.html">Kapital You Joint Venture Agreement</a> is a template for establishing a Human Capitalist business, and is still under construction here on GitHub. Feel free to have a look at the current incomplete draft to see if it contains anything that would be useful for you, and if you have any suggestions or corrections, a GitHub pull request would be more than welcome!

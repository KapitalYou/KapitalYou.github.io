**1. Working for yourself is better than working for someone else**

**2. Working with others is better than trying to do everything on your own**

**3. This means that working for ourselves together is the best possible way to work!**


At KapitalYou.com we are working on a curated set of opensource tools to help independent entrepreneurs to establish and run joint venture companies, so they can work together with each other while maintaining the autonomy of having their own businesses.

Watch this space!

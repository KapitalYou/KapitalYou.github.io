summary: The two core principles of a Human Capitalist business are to not subordinate anyone, and to treat human time and effort as a contribution of capital instead of as a purchase of labor. It will also help to follow the principles of Full Information, Direct Democracy, Minority Protection, Majority Protection, Residual Value, Goal Congruence, Indemnity, Responsibility, Limited Liability, Efficiency, Fractalism, Tax Effectiveness, and Legal Effectiveness.

A Human Capitalist business is based on the principles of non-subordination and of recognising human time and effort as a contribution of capital.

To effectively implement these principles however, you need to do more than just prevent a business from having employees; you also need to deal with the difficult question of how the business might just be delegating it's subordination to other businesses when it buys goods or services on the open market, or receives income from subsidiary businesses that subordinate people, or the business receives things from a contributor that were obtained via subordination. 

For example, if a company has no employees, but depends instead on goods and services from subordinating businesses controlled by the company's contributors, then the company is nothing more than a traditional joint venture between traditional capitalists. That is not a Human Capitalist company. Any definition of Human Capitalism that seeks to reduce subordination must deal with this issue of indirect subordination too.

In practical terms though, it's very difficult to conduct a business while avoiding all forms of indirect subordination. A company might have no employees or subsidiaries, and be a type of business that doesn't need any raw materials or trading stock - but what about needing electricity? What about fuel, rent, tools, vehicles, computer equipment, internet, or a phone plan? All of these will probably involve paying money to another business that subordinates people in order to deliver products or services to you. 

There might be some specific businesses that could exist without indirect subordination, but in most cases a Human Capitalist organization that hopes to succeed as a business, and thereby reduce the net amount of subordination in the world, will also have to accept that it will create a certain amount of indirect subordination, and must therefore define what types of indirect subordination it is willing to accept, and under which circumstances. 

There is probably a wide spectrum of rules that a Human Capitalist business could adopt with regards to indirect subordination, from the very prohibitive to the very permissive, while still being effective at creating a net reduction in subordination. Employment based businesses are fundamentally subordinating. Any business that can prosper while replacing employment with contributions of human capital, without increasing the amount of productive effort that is outsourced to other organisations, will liberate its own contributors from subordination but will not create any more indirect subordination than would have been created if its contributors were employed in a similarly successful business.


There are also some supporting principles that will be important to most organisations when designing a business structure:

**Full Information** - Contributors cannot effectively exercise their control over the business if they are not informed of all matters related to the business. To the extent allowed by privacy laws, all contributors should have free and convenient access to all information about the business and all other information that the business has.

**Direct Democracy** - Contributors control over the business is reduced if they must rely on elected representatives, but their control will be maximised if the business is structured in a way that allows them to directly vote on business decisions, and that binds any director or other senior officer of the organisation to only take actions that have been approved by a direct vote of contributors.

**Minority Protection** - Minority contributors will not be able to effectively exercise any control over the business unless there are minority protections in place, such as providing a veto power or by requiring unanimous votes for some types of decisions.

**Majority Protection** - Majority shareholders could be held to ransom by a single minority contributor exercising a power of veto unless there are deadlock-breaking provisions in place, such as forced buyout of a minority contributors interest at a predetermined price.

**Residual Value** - If share of control and profits is based only on current contributions, then contributors could be cheated out of the value of their contribution if most of the profit resulting from that contribution occurs at a later time when they are no longer contributing. This might be the case with businesses that have large up-front investments and low ongoing running costs. The business structure should account for the residual value in a contribution that continues to generate profits long after the contribution has been made, and provide contributors with an ongoing share of business control and profits that reflects whatever ongoing value of their past contributions still exists. 

**Goal Congruence** - Achieving voting consensus will be easier and more efficient if every contributor has similar incentives. As much as possible, all contributors should have the same type of interest in the business, varying only in amount. Designs that introduce different share classes, fixed vs variable compensation schemes, or different classes of voting rights will create a divergence of incentives that will reduce goal congruence and undermine the cohesion and efficiency of the organisation.

**Indemnity** - Certain contributions, such as acting as the director of a company, can expose a contributor to significant legal liability. Given that directors of a Human Capitalist company do not have the same decision making flexibility that company directors normally have, and because courts are likely to hold that ALL contributors are in fact shadow directors due to their having voting power, the business should indemnify all contributors against any legal liability they incur due to acting in accordance with their responsibilities to the organisation, and should exempt them from taking any action that would foreseeably lead to such liability and that they would otherwise have a responsibility to take. 

**Responsibility** - The business structure should enforce the responsibility that contributors have to deliver their agreed contributions, and to support the business, and to support its Human Capitalist principles. 

**Limited Liability** - The business structure should not expose contributors to more liability than they would have as owners of an equivalent subordinating business. 

**Efficiency** - The decentralisation of voting power and decision making in a Human Capitalist organisation imposes communication and information sharing requirements that are greater than those of a centralised organisation. The business structure should enable the use of technology and other means that can offset these additional needs. 

**Fractalism** - Large Human Capitalist organisations should be composed out of distinct smaller Human Capitalist organisations that contribute to and control them, to avoid any one organisation becoming too large and complex for its contributors to control. 

**Tax Effectiveness** - The business structure should be tax effective and avoid obvious problems such as contributors incurring large tax liabilities for the receipt of shares, long in advance of any prospects of receiving income from those shares. 

**Legal Effectiveness** - The business structure should not be rendered ineffective by statute or common law of any jurisdictions in which it is incorporated or operates - for example in the USA, shareholder contributors will not be able to control the decisions of the companies directors unless the company is "closely held" and the contributors are directly involved in running the business themselves.
